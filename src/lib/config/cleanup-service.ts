/**
 * Cleanup Service
 *
 * Removes the per-company webhooks registered on install. Fluid removes
 * webhooks itself when a droplet is uninstalled, so this is belt-and-braces.
 *
 * Callback registrations are cleaned up by
 * src/lib/callbacks/registration.ts#cleanupCallbacksForCompany, which deletes
 * by the uuids this droplet recorded at install rather than by scanning the
 * company-scoped listing — that listing also contains other droplets'
 * registrations, and matching them by definition name would delete theirs.
