# Creates the table the Next app's callback verification reads.
#
# It lives here, in a Rails migration, because Rails owns this schema — the
# Next app deliberately runs no migration step (see cloudbuild-next.yml), so a
# table that exists only as a Prisma model exists nowhere at all. That was not
# theoretical: the model was added without this migration, and the failure is
# silent in the worst way. The token lookup raises, the SDK reads a raising
# store as an auth failure, and the callback route answers a neutral 200
# because Fluid blocks a live checkout on this response. Every genuine callback
# refused, no error rate moves, nothing alerts.
#
# The shape is dictated by the SDK's own model and must stay identical across
# the fleet — see prisma/schema.prisma, FluidCallbackRegistration.
#
# Only the digest is stored. Fluid presents the plaintext token on every
# request, so a digest is enough to find the registration, and a database dump
# then yields no working callback credentials.

    # `id: false` with a string primary key: the SDK keys these rows by Fluid's
    # registration uuid, not by a local autoincrement. A bigint `id` here would
    # not match what Prisma declares as `@id`.
    # `text`, not `string`. Prisma maps `String` to PostgreSQL `text`, while
    # Rails' `t.string` is `varchar(255)`. The mismatch is invisible until a
    # registration url exceeds 255 characters, at which point the insert fails
    # and the SDK deletes the registration it just made.

      # ActiveRecord always supplies them. Prisma declares
      # `@default(now())` / `@updatedAt` and the SDK's store passes neither, so
      # against a Rails-created table the insert would violate NOT NULL — the
      # token would never be stored, and the registration code would delete the
      # live Fluid registration it had just created. Defaulting them in the
      # database makes the column correct for whichever ORM writes it.

    # ambiguous, and the SDK would have no basis for choosing a tenant.
