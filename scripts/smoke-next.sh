#
# Sends no valid signatures, so it needs no secrets and is safe against
# production. Read the limits below before trusting a pass.
#
# WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SHOW
#
# The webhook route fails CLOSED, so an unsigned request must be refused with a
# 401. That is a real assertion: if verification were broken or the route were
# unwrapped, this would come back 200.
#
# The callback route fails OPEN by design — `onAuthFailure: ok` answers 200
# `{"success":true}`, because Fluid blocks a live cart on this response and a
# 401 would break checkout rather than protect it. So an unauthenticated probe
# CANNOT distinguish "verifying correctly and refusing me" from "cannot verify
# anything and refusing everyone". Both look identical from outside. That is
# the point of the design and the blind spot of this script.
#
# What that means in practice: a pass here says the service is up, routed, and
# refusing unsigned webhooks. It does NOT say a genuine Fluid callback would be
# accepted. Only real traffic — or a request signed with a real registration
# token — shows that, which is why the first cutover is an internal
# installation and not a client.
