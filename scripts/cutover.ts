/**
 * Moves ONE company's callback registrations between the Rails app and the
 * Next app, and repairs the state left behind when that goes wrong halfway.
 *
 *   pnpm cutover status    <fluid_shop>
 *   APPLY=1 pnpm cutover repoint   <fluid_shop> --url https://<app>-next-...run.app
 *   APPLY=1 pnpm cutover reconcile <fluid_shop>
 *
 * CUTOVER.md used to say "repoint it" and leave the operator to improvise.
 *
 * The important thing about this operation, established from Fluid's own
 * source rather than assumed:
 *
 *   - `Callback::Registration` sets `verification_token` in `before_create`
 *     ONLY. An update never rotates it.
 *   - `RegistrationBlueprint`'s `:shared` view exposes `verification_token`,
 *     and both `api_index` and `api_show` include that view. `api_update` does
 *     NOT.
 *   - `UpdateAction` accepts `url`.
 *
 * Together those mean a repoint is an UPDATE, not a delete-then-create. The
 * registration keeps its uuid and its token; only the url moves. That removes
 * both failure modes the delete-create shape has: there is never a moment when
 * the definition has no registration and Fluid silently stops calling, and
 * there is no create response whose loss strands a live registration whose
 * token was issued exactly once and received by nobody.
 *
 * The token is then read back from the listing and its digest stored. Fluid
 * enforces one registration per definition_name per owner, so this is still a
 * genuine switch rather than a fan-out — but it is a switch with no gap.
 *
 * Delete-then-create remains only for the case where no registration exists to
 * update.
 *
 * Writes require APPLY=1. `status` never writes.
